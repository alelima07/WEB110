            <h3>History of Web Accessibility</h3>
            <p>Nowadays, Web Accessibility is not something that just started, it actually has been around for a long time. The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) launched in 1997, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (requiring any websites developed for federal government use to be accessible to disabled users) was signed into law in 1998, and the first Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 1.0) were published as an official W3C recommendation in 1999 (Hoffmann)1.</p>

           <p>Although it’s a requirement, unfortunately, there is still an array of websites that are not giving credits to its importance. Those websites encounter discrimination litigation for violating Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which is being interpreted to include websites as “places of public accommodation” (Rivenburgh)2. According to David of the Bureau of Internet Accessibility, "In 2018, there were 2,258 web accessibility lawsuits filed in the U.S., nearly tripling from the 814 lawsuits in 2017."(David).</p>

           <h3>Web Accessibility</h3>

           <p>Compared to years ago, today we all have the great benefit to have an infinite source of knowledge that is found in websites. Thanks to the advance of technology in websites, we can talk to tons of friends at the same time no matter how distant they are from us, we can order food, rent a hotel room, plan a trip, watch videos and our favorite shows, check our bank status and even pay bills. It does sound amazing, however, this benefit does not apply to everyone. According to the world bank, 15% of the global population experiences some form of disability. This means that for one billion people, their life is not as easy as it should be.</p>

           <p>Fortunately, today we already have Web Accessibility Standards created by W3C that help us as web developers to make websites accessible to everybody. According to them, the disabilities that affect access to the web are auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech and visual. For each one of those, there is a way to make the user’s life easier. W3C lists 3 different types of components that put the web together, and for each one of those, there is a standard for web developers to follow to make the web accessible, and here they are.</p>

           <p>First is the Web Content, it refers to any part of the website, including, images, forms, multimedia, and texts. The second one is the User Agents, it is the software that people use to access the web, like desktop browsers, voice browsers, mobile phones, and assistive technology. And the third one is the Authoring Tools, it is the software developers use to create all the web content, like code editors, databases and other tools.</p>
