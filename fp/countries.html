        <h2 class="subheader">Places Visited</h2>
        <p>This website was made with a purpose to share my own experience around the world. I’ve been to 52 countries and explored six continents. I’ve seen several castles in Europe including the ones in London, in Denmark and Dracula’s castle in Transylvania. Furthermore, Archaeological sites such as The Parthenon in Athens, Easter Islands, Maia site in Mexico and Belize, Rome and its marvelous coliseum and many others. I’ve had a lot of contact with nature, under water, in the Amazon or in the desert when I rode a camel in Dubai. I have swum with stingrays, dolphins, and for several times I went snorkeling joined by an array of colorful fishes and huge turtles. I want to share all of my knowledge with everyone and hopefully increase people’s interest in traveling.</p>
